# Note

When adding a tag, they are working perfectly fine, you can add 1, 2 or as many tags as you'd like,
once added, the container with the information will disappear (thats because the filtering wasnt working the way I wanted)
but if you try to filter the tag, the container will pop up again

for example you create a tag TAG1, try to search for TAG1 and it will appear once again.
